#### 5. View Hugo locally:

#### 6. Making Edits:
In order to create the nice copy-to-clipboard and 'click to view diff' features, we're using a strategy of pre-processing markdown files to generate source content that is then read by Hugo.

0. Start the hugo server using the step above
1. Edit files in `website/source_content`
2. `cd website/scripts`
3. `npm run build`
4. Check for updated content in the browser. 
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you're happy with the content.

note: shift-reload may be necessary in your browser to reflect the latest changes.
